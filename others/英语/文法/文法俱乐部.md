### 名词词组与冠词

#### 专有名词与补语位置

人名、地名等都是专有名词，它代表的对象只有一个

	There are five Sundays this month. (这个月有五个星期日)
	Sunday 为非专有名词

	I have an appointment on Sunday. (我星期日有约)
	Sunday 为专有名词

	Mr.Elson was president of the high school. (埃尔森先生曾是这所高中的校长)
	Mr.Elson 是人名，为专有名词，没有第二个存在，所以不能加限定词；而 president 是 Mr.Elson 的补语，等价于 Mr.Elson，所以 president 也作为专有名词来诠释

	Some say he was a better president than Mr.Robert. (有人说他当校长，比罗伯特先生干得更好。)
	he 指代上文的 Mr.Elson。 president 仍是主语补语，需要加限定词的原因是因为在上下文中和罗伯特先生做比较，前后两任校长就不是专有名词了

	Mr.Elson is also a member of the Council of the city. (埃尔森先生也是该城市政会委员。)
	市政会委员有多个，所以 member 为非专有名词

	Mattin Wales, Head of the football team, at the time, wore a mustache. (马丁·威尔斯，当时的足球队长，留有小胡子。)
	Head of the football team = who was head of the football team at the time 与 Mattin Wales 是同等关系，所以 head 不用限定词

	Clinton made Gorle campaign partner of the Presidential election. (克林顿选择戈尔为总统大选竞选搭档。)
	campaign partner 为专有名词，是 Gorle 的补语

#### 定冠词 the 的用法

the 可视为 that 或 those 的弱化形式，有明确的指示功能。凡是上下文中有明指或暗示时，便要用定冠词 the

	I need a book to read on my trip. (我在旅途中需要带本书读。)
	a book = one book | any book

	I have finished the book you lent me. (我已经把你借给我的书读完了。)
	the book = that book

	Modern history is my favorite subject. (现代史是我最喜欢的科目。)

	The history of recent China is a sorry record. (中国近代史是部伤心史。)

	He should be home; I saw a light in his house. (他应该在家；我看见他家灯亮了。)

	Turn off the portal light. (把门口的灯关掉。)

	I'm going to the office now. (我现在要去办公室。)

	Do you mind if I open the window? (我可以把这扇窗户打开吗？)

#### 定冠词与专有名词

	This is not the John Smith I know. (这不是我所认识的约翰·史密斯。)
	暗示约翰·史密斯有另一面，有两个史密斯存在，所以人名就不再是专有名词

	This is a photography show of the Taipei 50 years ago. (这是表现50年前的台北摄影展。)
	50年前的台北暗示和今日的台北不同了，有两个台北，所以 Taipei 就成了非专有名词

有些专有名词前加定冠词 the 并非是例外，本身就是非专有名词

	the Pacific (Ocean) 太平洋
	the Atlantic (Ocean) 大西洋
	the Indian Ocean 印度洋
	the Mediterranean (Sea) 地中海
	the Dead Sea 死海
	ocean 和 sea 本身就是非专有名词，定冠词配合的就是省略掉的普通名词

	the Philippine Islands -> the Philippines (菲律宾群岛)
	the Alp mountains -> the Alps (阿尔卑斯山)

	the Mississippi (River) 密西西比河
	the Titanic (Ship) 泰坦尼克号
	the Hilton (Hotel) 希尔顿饭店

	the United States of America (美国)
	the United Nations (联合国)

### 动词时态

#### 简单式

把 be 动词当动词看，后面的分词视为形容词补语

1. 过去时间

		The U.S. established diplomatic relations with the P.R.C.in 1979. (美国与中华人民共和国于 1979 年建交。）

		The movable print was introduced to England in 1485. (活版印刷于 1485 年被引进英国。)
		过去分词表示被动

		I was visiting clients the whole day yesterday. (昨天一整天我一直在拜访客户。)
		visiting clients 可以视为现在分词短语，作为形容词补语来形容主语，表示一种持续性

		I was watching TV when I heard the doorbell. (听到门铃响的时候，我正在看电视。)

		The witness was being questioned in court when he had a heart attack. (证人心脏病突发时，他长在法庭上被质询。)
		was 表示时态为过去时间，being 表示正在发生或持续，questioned 表示被动

2. 现在时间

		Bush is the U.S. President. (布什是美国总统。)
		几年前他不是总统，几年后他也可能不是总统了，所以这是一个以现在时间为中心的括号

		All mothers love their children. (天下的妈妈都爱自己的小孩。)

		7-ELEVEN is selling big cokes at a discount this month. (统一超市这个月大杯可乐打折。)
		this month 是以现在为中心的一个括弧，打折是一个持续性的活动，所以用现在分词短语 selling big cokes

		According to the NASA survey, the ozone layer is being depleted. (根据美国国家航空和航天局的研究，臭氧层正在被消耗中。)

3. 未来时间

		There will be a major election in March. (三月将有一次大选。)
		未来的事还未发生，尚未确定，所以要使用助动词 will 来表示不确定性

		Don't call me at six tomorrow. I'll still be sleeping then. (不要在明天六点打电话给我，我那时还在睡觉。)

		The building will be razed next month. (这个房子下个月拆除。)

#### 完成式

1. 现在时间

		I'm sure I have seen this face somewhere. (我肯定曾经见过这张脸。)
		不确定动作的具体时间，是在哪一个时段发生的，只有一个箭头的形状表示截止时间是现在

		We have been working overtime for a week to fill your order. (我们连续加班一个星期赶出你订的货。)

		The house has been redecorated twice since they moved in. (打从他们搬来算起，这栋房子已经被装修过两次了。)
		表示的时间是从他们搬进来到现在这一段时间

2. 过去时间

		Many soldiers had died from pneumonia before the discovecry of penicilin. (发现盘尼西林以前，已经有很多士兵死于肺炎。)

		I had been smoking three packs of cigarettes a day before I decided to quit. (我决定戒烟之前，每天要抽三包烟。)

		Japan had not been defeated yet by the time Germany surrendered unconditionally. (到德国无条件投降为止，日本尚未被打败。)

3. 未来时间

		Next April, I will have worked here for 20 years. (到四月，我在这里就工作 20 年了。)
		next April 并不是未来的一个时间点，而是一个截至时间

		Come back at 5:00. Your car will have been fixed by then. (五点再来吧！到时候你的车一定已经修好了。)
		截至时间是在未来，真正修好的时间可能是四点，也可能是三点，所以要用未来完成时

		In two more minutes, she will have been talking on the phone for three hours! (再过两分钟，她就一直打了足足三小时的电话了！)

### 不定词短语

把不定词视为助动词的变化

#### 不定词与助动词的共同点

	I am glad to know you. (很高兴能认识你。)
	还原成原句
	I am glad because I can know you.
	I am glad because I am able to know you.
	副词从句中的主词 I 与主要从句中的主语一致可省略，be 动词 am 没有实际意义也随着主词省略，从句没有主词和动词连接词也要省略
	able to know = can know = to know

1. 后面都要接原形动词。

		I will go. (我要走了。)
		I want to go. (我想去。)

2. 都有不确定的语气。

		He is right. (他是对的。)
		He may be right. (他可能是对的。)
		He seems to be right. (他好像是对的。)

3. 都要用完成是来表达相对的过去时间。

		It must be raining now. (一定下雨了。)
		It may rain any minute. (随时都可能下雨。)
		It might even snow. (说不定还会下雪。)
		助动词没有办法表示过去的时间，在例句中 may 和 might 都是表示未来时态，might 并不是 may 的过去式，might 表示比较没有把握的猜测语气

		It must have rained last night. (昨晚一定下过雨。)
		猜测过去的事情，must、may、might 都只能表示语气强弱的差别
		It seems to have rained last night. (昨晚好像下过雨。)

4. 所有重要的语气助动词都可以改写为不定词 

		must -> have to
		should -> ought to
		will/would -> be going to
		can/could - be able to
		may/might -> be likely to

#### 不定词与动名词的区分

	They plan to marry next month. (他们计划下个月结婚。)
	They plan that they will marry next month.
	they will marry = they are to marry

	I avoid making the same mistake twice. (我避免犯同样的错误。)
	avoid 本身是具有否定的暗示，如果后面加不定词的话表示避免将要犯同样的错误，不合理

	I hate to say this, but I think you're mistaken. (对不起，你错了。)
	to say = I have to say = I must say

	I like to be the first. (我喜欢排第一。)
	to be = I can be
	I don't like to wait too long. (我不喜欢等太久。)
	to wait = I will wait
	I dislike standing in long lines. (我讨厌排队。)
	dislike 后面接不定词就不太合适

	I always try to be on time. (我总是力求准时。)
	to be = I can be 
	准时不是每次都能做到，有不确定的因素，所以用不定词
	Why don't you try being late for a change? (你何不故意迟到一次呢？)
	迟到是一定能做到的，用不定词就不合适

#### 使役动词与原形动词

	The little girl asked her mother to come to the PTA meeting. (小女孩邀请妈妈来开家长会。)
	The little girl asked if her mother would come to the PTA meeting.
	ask 是普通动词，邀请人参加会存在不确定性，所以会使用不定词

	The teacher made the little girl stay behind. (老师叫小女孩留下来。)
	使役动词是强迫性的命令语气，不具有不确定性，所以不能用不定词

#### 感官动词与原形动词

	I heard her playing the violin. (我听到她在拉小提琴。)
	感官动词也不适合用不定词，没有不确定性

	I heard her cry out in pain. (我听到她痛得大叫一声。)

	She was crying in pain. (她很痛苦，一直哭。)

#### 练习

1. Not wishing to attend the dance, Marie (made believe) that she had a fever. (D)
2. He is said by his friends (to be gentle and gracious). (A)?

### 动名词

表示“动作”，也可以有“持续性”的暗示

#### 动名词与普通名词的比较

	Let me buy you a drink. (我请你喝一杯。)

	Drinking is his only vice. (喝酒是他唯一的坏习惯。)
	drinking 表示习惯性、经常性的喝

	I am not afraid of death, but I am scared of dying. (死亡我倒不怕，只是怕死的过程。)

	There are two weddings at the restaurant tonight. (这家餐厅今晚有两场婚礼。)

#### 动名词短语与名词从句

	I really enjoyed teaching English to school children at night. (那时我晚上教儿童英语教得很愉快。)
	teaching English to school children at night 为动名词短语 还原成名词从句为:
	I taught English to school children at night. 
	从简化的角度分析省略重复的主语 I，动词有意义不能直接省略，可以变成动名词或不定词，这句主要表达的是持续进行的活动，所以用动名词

	I don't like that John calls my girlfriend day after day. (约翰每天打电话给我女朋友，让我很不舒服。)
	I don't like John's calling my girlfriend day after day.
	名词从句中的主语与主要子句的主语不同，所以不能省略，变成 John 的所有格，就可以附在 calling 的前面了

	That I was invited here is a great honor. (受邀来到此地，是莫大的荣誉。)
	Being inveted here is a great honor.
	that I was 被省略掉之后 invited here 是过去分词短语，形容词词性，不能作为主词，如果当主词的话需要变为名词或+being，保留被动态

#### 动名词与现在分词的分辨

	That flying bird is a black-faced spoonbill. (那只在飞的鸟是黑面篦鹭。)
	flying 在名词短语中间的形容词位置，所以是现在分词，现在分词都是形容词
	That bird is flying. 

	That flying jacket looks smart on you. (那件飞行装你穿起来很帅。)
	此处的 flying 是动名词，放在名词短语中做复合名词
	That jacket is flying. (×)
	放在介词后检验是否为动名词
	That's a jacket for flying. a flying jacket = a jacket for flying

#### 练习
1. The barber's apprentice practiced shaving(shave) on a watermelon. (B)
2. I love watching/to watch(watch) horror movies alone. (B)(C)

### 分词

#### 分词与形容词

	That black dog doesn't bite. (那只黑狗不咬人。)
	A barking dog doesn't bite. (爱叫的狗不咬人。)

	The dog is black. (那是只黑狗。)
	The dog is barking. (那只狗在叫。)

	Boiled water is safe to drink. (开水可以安全饮用。)

	The water is clean. (说很干净。)
	The water is boiled. (水是煮开过的。)

#### 带有完成暗示而非被动态的过去分词

	The leaves are all fallen, now that winter is here. (冬天一到，叶子全掉光了。)

	I am done. It's all yours. (我已经好了，该你用了。)

#### 现在分词与过去分词的区分

	He is disappointed at his scores. (他对分数很失望。)
	His scores are disappointing. (他的分数令人失望。)
	His scores disappoint him. (他的分数令他失望。)
	主词是 his scores，主语为人时为被动，主语为分数时是主动

	Water consists of hydrogen and oxygen. 
	Water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen. (水由氢分子和氧分子组成。)
	consist 是不及物动词，没有被动态，也没有宾语
	compose 是及物动词，有被动语态

	I have no comment to make while the case is being investigated by police. (本案正由警方调查中，我暂时不予置评。)
	be 动词看作动词，两个分词看作形容词。being 表示正在，investigated 表示被调查

#### 形容词从句简化的结果

	Toys made in Taiwan are much better now. (现在台湾制造的玩具好多了。)
	Toys which are made in Taiwan are much better now.
	which 与 toys 重复，be 动词无意义，去掉这两个部分剩下的分词 made in Taiwan 还是形容词类，因而可以简化
