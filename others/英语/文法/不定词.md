#### 作为名词

- 主词

		To buy things in a flea market must be fun.
		在跳蚤市场买东西一定很有趣。
		must 助动词 + be 动词原形
		动词前面一般是主词。有趣不是指市场，而是在市场买东西会很有趣，所以主词是 [to buy things in a flea market]，而主要主词是 [to buy]

		环游世界很好玩。
		主要主词是 [to travel]

		To answer this question is difficult for me.
		It is difficult for me to answer this question.
		对我而言回答这个问题是困难的。

		It is hard for people in Taiwan to solve pollution problems.

		[question] 表示有疑问（带问号）的问题，回答问题使用 [answer the question]。问号 [question mark]

		To be patient with others is best for you.
		It is best for you to be patient with others.
		对别人有耐心对你而言是最好的。
		[patient] 是形容词，to 后面只能接原形动词，形容词要在 be 动词后，所以是 to be，在这里不用翻译
		对...有耐心使用介词 [with]

		It's kind of you to help me.
		You are kind to help me.
		你能帮助我真是太好了。
